# Back to top

1. Add `back_to_top: true` and `back_to_top_text: "Back to top"` to the site configuration.

1. Check that a link to the top of the page appears at the bottom of each page, independently of the configuration of other footer info such as `gh_edit_link`.

1. Check that the text of the link changes when the value of `back_to_top_text` is updated in the site configuration.
